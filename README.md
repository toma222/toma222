### Welcome to my github profile!

## About me
- My favorite movie : The life aquatic with steave zisouh
- My favorite game : The Return of the Obra Dinn

## Current projects
- Snowcrash - It's a game engine that I am making for fun
  
## What do I like to make?
I love to make game engines. Most repositories are failed game engines (lol). Currently, I am trying to make ONE FINAL ENGINE: snowcrash!

## Why is your code from old archived project so bad?
I am going to play the self taught card here. I didn't realy follow any tutorials, and just started programing. I got better over the years, but looking back on certain projects make me cry (So many memory leaks on old engines ðŸ˜ž)
